  <h2>Pillars fo tokenization</h2>
  <img src="token-framework.png" style="box-shadow: none;border: none; max-width: 70%; max-height: 70%;">
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Market Design</h2>
  <section data-transition="slide">
  <ul>
    <li>Tokeneconmics is also about environment i.e. <b>Market</b></li>
    <li>When creating the environment, if you can nail : 
    <ul style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
      <li><a href="#/demand">Thickness of Market - <b>Demand</b></a></li>
      <li><a href="#/decongestion">Decongestion - <b>Ease of transaction</b></a></li>
      <li><a href="#/safety">Safety - <b>Safe to use</b></a></li>
    </ul>
     then users are more likely to use your system.</li>
  </ul>
 </section>
 <section id="demand" data-transition="slide">
  <ul>
    <li>Generate <b>Demand</b> or increase <b>thickness (size) of network</b> by bringing all the relevant parties who want to transact together.Launching a ride-hailing business in the small rural city of 250 people is not a good idea.</li>
  </ul>
 </section>
 <section id="decongestion" data-transition="slide">
  <ul>
    <li>Make sure to <b>Decongest</b> or <b>reduce congestion in the network</b>  by having the system to help people make better choices. Launching a ride-hailing business in a big-city which has one main road with 2 lanes is not a good idea as vehicle will remain stuck in traffic.</li>
  </ul>
 </section>
 <section id="safety" data-transition="slide">
  <ul>
    <li>Make it <b>easy</b> and <b>safe</b> for people to join. Fully autonomous coins, reduce information kept about the participants. Launching a ride-hailing business in mid-sized city that has considerable population plus roads with more lane, you realise that same city has tons of robbery; may jeoparadise the safety of drivers and passengers </li>
  </ul>
 </section>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Mechanism Design</h2>
  <section data-transition="slide">
  <ul>
    <li>In the crypto space, we can incentivise people to behave in a right (rational) way. This can be done through <a href="#/game-theory">game theory</a>.</li>
    <li>Mechanism design is designing the game based on outcome (inverse of game theory)</li>
    <li>Influence the behaviour of participant by <b>rewarding</b> good actions and <b>punishing</b> for bad actions</li>
  </ul>
</section>
 <section data-transition="slide">
  <ul>
    <li>In the Crypto Space we have got committees of people to vote on issues. When we reach consensus, the issue is resolved. </li>
      <li>Mechanism design affects the actions and behaviours of people in your network. This will affect the long-term sustainability of the project. Imagine if it is easy to bribe the president, the economy will not do well.</li>
  </ul>
  </section>
  <section data-transition="slide">
    <ul style="list-style: none;">
    <li>Bribery can happen and it can be affected by</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Having a lot of people on the committee. So it is expensive to bribe. (De-incentive)</li>
      <li>Randomly allocate users to be on the committee, so you don’t know who to bribe. (De-incentive)</li>
      <li>To raise an issue to the committee of people, you have to put some tokens into the fund. If it turns out that you are a bad actor, you lose those tokens. (Punishment)</li>
    </ul>  
  </ul>
  </section>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Implementing Mechanism Design</h2>
  <section data-transition="slide">
  <ul>
    <li>Understand what the goal/objective of the system is. If this is a game, what is the goal of the game?</li>
    <li>Consider the information available, for participants to make an informed decision.</li>
    <li>What types of behaviours do you want to encourage?</li>
    <li>What can you do to incentivise it?</li>
    <li>How can you punish bad actors?</li>

<section id="stable-coin-mechanism">
  <h2>Stable coin mechanisms</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Instead of a central bank affecting the value of money, the project has various ways for the coin to maintain a stable value, in comparison to another asset (e.g. USD)</li>
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
          <li>E.g. One cookie is worth one cup of milk. One day, all the cows die and there is a shortage of milk. How do you manage the system of cookie to milk exchange?</li>
      </ul>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Auction/Payments</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Instead of a centralised system setting the payment price, you (the buyer) set your own price and compete with other buyers to receive the object.</li>
    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
      <li>E.g. Miner receive block reward and transaction fees after mining which is little in beginning as no one is in the market. So, more reward to mine on the network. As the network grows, there are MORE transactions. So, block rewards reduce and transaction fees increase.</li>
  </ul>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="voting">
  <h2>Voting</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Instead of a centralised system making decisions and changes, you (the token holder) can vote on issues and take ownership of the changes.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="oracle">
  <h2>Oracle</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Instead of a centralised entity giving input/answers to the system, you (the network participant) can add information into the oracle to be evaluated.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="tcr">
  <h2>Token curated registries</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Instead of having a centralised entity like Buzzfeed to rank “best cheesecake in Philly”, you (the voter) can curate the decentralised list.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Token Design</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Token design is everything that involves the token, for example, how are the tokens used to incentivise specific behaviour, total supply, and token governance.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Architecture</li>
      <li>Incentive</li>
      <li>Token structure</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Token Design (punch)</h2>
  <p>The unique thing about token ecosystem is that everything is <b>decentralised</b>. That means many of the token design “rules” has to be coded or embedded into the system.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>While designing token ask yourself</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>What is the true purpose of a token?</li>
    <li>Why do you need a decentralised network for your product/project?</li>
    <li>What incentives are you giving to the users?</li>
    <li>What is the ideal token design structure you’d like? (e.g. inflation rate, allocation, distribution schemes, total supply,)</li>
    <li>Are you pegging your token valuation to a real currency? What is the possible limitation to that?(may not be applicable)</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Token use case</h2>
  <ul style="list-style: none;">
    <li>A token can realize data such as </li>
    <ul style="list-style: circle;">
      <li>Identity documents</li>
      <li>Voting records</li>
      <li>Contracts</li>  
      <li>Game characters</li>       
      <li>Stock ownership</li>        
      <li>Usage rights (such as a software license or computing services)</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

<section>
  <h2>Crowd Sales</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Air Drops</li>
    <li>ICOs</li>
    <li>IEOs</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Air Drops</h2>
  <p>Airdrops is a process by which the company distributes its tokens to wallets of certain user, completely free of charge.</p>
  <img src="airdrop.jpg" style="max-width: 50%; max-height: 60%;">
</section>

<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
  ## Purpose of Air Drop
  * Generating Awareness
  * Understanding Users
  * Raising funds
  * Rewarding or inspiring loyalty
  * Wider distribution of token
  * Hard forks

<section data-markdown=""><script type="text/template">
  ## ICO - Initial Coin Offering
  * ICO is crypto world’s public crowdsale. If a project wants to launch a new coin/dApp, conducting an ICO attracts investor to their ecosystem.
  
  * DApp developers can get required funding for their dApp through ICO crowdsale.
  
  * Anyone can become the investor in a project they are interested by purchasing the token of particular dApp and become a stakeholder of the project.

  ## IEO - Intial Exchange Offering
  * Also  known as ICO 2.0, IEOs enable establishment of a “trusted entity”. Trusted entity is the cryptocurrency exchange
  * Benefits of IEOs
  * Projects hosted by exchanges are legitimate.
  * Tokens listed on exchange are immediately tradable
  * Less Noise

  <h2>Centralized v/s Decentralized Exchange</h2>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Decentralized Exchange</h2>
  <section>
    <ul>
      <li>In most exchanges, only the asset exchange is decentralized, as the assets are cryptocurrencies deployed on the blockchain that no central entity controls.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <ul>
      <li>Due to KYC and AML regulations, exchanges are often required to seek users’ identities for capital deposits, creating centralized record-collection and data-storage of personal information. Centralized exchanges give users permission to transact currencies, rather than creating a permissionless ecosystem.</li>

  <h2>Game Theory</h2>
  <section data-transition="slide">
    <ul style="list-style: none;">
      <li>Game theory is basically strategic decision making. You look at the options, consider the outcomes to the solutions and make the best decision.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section data-transition="slide">
  <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
    <li>Imagine there is a sealed cookie jar at home. Mum says that no one can eat the cookie. You and your sister both wants the cookie. What options are there?</li>

  <h2>Time lock Contracts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Allow users to lock up their tokens.</li>
    <li>Tokens can be released again after specified amount of time before a user who has decided to unlock his tokens actually receives them back (cliff vesting).</li>
    <li>The contract can be used for any token that follows the ERC20 standard and the same instance can be used by an arbitrary number of users</li>
